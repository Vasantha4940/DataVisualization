			<h4>FORCE DIRECTED GRAPH </h4>
			<p> Force Directed graphs/networks are obtained by using the Force-directed graph drawing algorithms which is mainly based on the forces assigned among the set of nodes and edges of a graph.The forces can be either attractive which is used to attract pairs of endpoints of the graph's edges towards each other or repulsive which is used to seperate all pairs of nodes. </p>
			<h4>PERFORMANCE OF THE FORCE DIRECTED GRAPH VISUALIZATION</h4>
			<p>The force directed graph/network visualization of more than 2000 nodes takes lot of time and hence degrades the overall performance 
			<h4>OPTIMIZATION USING WEB WORKERS:</h4>
			<p>In order to optimize the performance in terms of the time taken to visualize a large network of more than 2000 nodes,we can use web workers.Web workers are mainly based on the concept like parallel processing in web.They work by splitting the tasks across different workers without affecting the actual UI.</p>
			<h4>FEATURES</h4>
			<ul>
			<li> Different layouts </li>
			<li> Zoom in and zoom out </li>
			<li> Getting all the nodes that are connected to a particular node on selection of a particular node </li>
			</ul>
